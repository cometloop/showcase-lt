# LT Showcase

## Summary

- We show 3 random photos if no search term is provided
- The filtered list of photos is shown when the query matches against photo titles.
- If we encounter an error calling the api, we show an error toast.
- If no photos match the search criteria, we show 'No results found'
- I committed .env files on purpose for ease of use for the showcase. Normally they would not be committed.

## Tech stack

- Front end - React typescript app created with create-react-app for speed.
- Back end - Node express app that acts only as a proxy server to get around the CORS issue with the enpodint provided.
- e2e tests: Playwright
